## Why

Q: Many other tools for building wordlists from input material already exist, why bother
with this?

A: Sometimes less is more. When you _only_ want generated passphrases that maintain
original apperance ordering, this is the tool you want. A massive keyspace generated
by one of those other tools will contain these values, of course, but they also will
have many, many, many other non-interested in outputs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install phrasegen
```

## Usage

```bash
phrasegen -h
```

e.g Generating passphrases from a movie script, of exactly 4 phrases each, joined by a
`-` character, without having scrubbed any of the punctuation from the source material
before after joining, forcing all to lowercase, and storing in an output file `gen.txt`:

```bash
phrasegen --join-str "-" \
    --file movie_script.txt \
    --only-size 4 \
    --no-strip-punc \
    --lowercase \
    -o gen.txt
```

Generating from a given string via CLI directly and/or outputting to STDOUT is also possible:

```bash
phrasegen --join-str "-" \
    --input "This is a sentence I'd like to use to generate a set of passphrases against." \
    --max-size 3 \
    --no-strip-punc \
    --lowercase
```

Outputs to STDOUT:

```text
this
is
a
sentence
i'd
like
to
use
to
generate
a
set
of
passphrases
against.
